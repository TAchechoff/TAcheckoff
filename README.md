# TAcheckoff
Final project
This is a Python code which does two things together. The first one is a driver for the sonar sensor which is connected to GPIO of Raspberry Pi. The second part is a socket connection under the code which checks whether the hand position is between 2 to 10 cm.
The c# code is the one on the server side that will display data send by the Raspberry Pi.
